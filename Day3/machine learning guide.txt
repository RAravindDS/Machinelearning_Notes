                                                                                   MACHINE LEARNING
                                                                                     1.SUPERVIESED LEARNING
                                                                                       2.UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
                                                                                         3.REINFORCEMENT LEARNING 



   1.SUPERVISED  LEARNING:
        *dependable variable(the value is predicted by the machine )
        *independable variable(the value is given by the domain or taken by the data sets) 
       (the model having the labels and features and targeted output -supervised learning)
        EX : the datasets consists of the label like male or female and we are going to predict who is not died after the disater)             HINTS:
                                                                                                                                               FEATURES(collected data)
                                                                                                                                               CSV - comma separated values 
   2.UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:                                                                                          
         * we have a data but we dont have a idea of what is output and what is going to predict
         * it will create a own model 



    SUPERVISED LEARNING :
              there are 2 types :
                        1. CLASSIFICATION
                        2. REGRESSION 
       1.CLASSIFICATION:
                        1.binary(true or false and  1 or 0)
                        2.discrete(they having the unique values)
                
       2.REGRESSION:
                   1.continuos(the input having the contious variable like infinty)
   
      

   BIAS:
        trainning error
        underfitting 
        
   VARIANCE:
         test error 
         overfitting

      	FLASK:
             it is used to save our model ans we use it in api

     

    WHEN TO USE THE MODEL:
            CLASSIFICATION:                      REGRESSION:
                 1.LOGISTIC                          1.LINEAR               
                 2.DESCISION                         2.GRADIENT DESCENT  
                 3.RANDOM FOREST                     3. REGULARISATION
                 4.NAIVE BAYES                       4. LASSO RIDGE
                 5.KNN      



         	WHEN TO USE THE MATRIX AND ERROR 
                      REGRESSION                         CLASSIFICATION:
                         1.MSE                                 1.ACCURACY_SCORE
                         2.RMSE                                2.CLASSIFICATION_REPORT
                         3.MAE                                 3.CONFUSED_MATRIX
                         4.R2_SCORE


        NOW OUR FIRST MODEL:
                          1.linear regression:

                                             *it is used for regression tasks (it is used to predict the two feautre in the input data like we have to predict the gpa using sat score)
                                             note : we have to reshape the variable here because model always want in arrays	
                                                  : and this is the regression model right so we use mse,mae,r2	,rmse,adjustedr2
